                                             We utilize the adaptive Agile methodology
                                                at its fullest. It focuses on continuously
                                                improving processes. We emphasize on

                                                with rapidly changing requirements. We
                                                use it for its flexibility, and adaptability.

- Lean 
                                             We use it for creating more value with
                                                fewer resources. It emphasizes efficiency
                                                optimization by eliminating waste,
